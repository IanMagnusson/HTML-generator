This is a HTML generator for lay-users to curate a simple website, with code 
injection security that was the final project of my Introduction to C, Unix/Linux
Programming, and Web Interfaces class. Code is a mix of class code and orignal and
ownership is specified below. Utilizes fl, a program from another assigment (source
code in subdirectory), that generates form letters from templates and data,repurposed
for HTML generation.

- EXTRA CREDIT: Code Injection Protection -
I have enhanced the scripts called by ewp.html with thourough protection against
code injection from the QUERY_STRING. Several implementations were trialled:
simply removing any special chars, reporting special chars with a fatal error,
individually policing different variables for distinct sets of dangerous special
chars. The final version addresses nearly all threats in one approach by
substituting HTML character codes for any input character that might cause any 
problem somewhere in the code. The only additional step required is to escape 
the &s in these character codes before they are used for sed substitution. I 
have settled on this approach because it allows the user to enter any character
they wish and it will go on to serve as any legitimate use as a literal
character in the final HTML output. One consiquence of this implementation is
that the reportbacks had to be changed to HTML content-type to correctly render
the special characters and avoid confusion for the end user.
mwp.cgi does not appear to need security measures of its own independent
from view_page.cgi. It appears that special chars that are not suppresed by ""
are still not reevaluated after being expanded from a variable. User can inject
HMTL into final echo of $PAGEDATA, but this only returns to user and is harmless.

- Ownership -
scripts add-update_item.cgi and view_page.cgi are from class, modified by Jack.
Delete_item.cgi is by Jack, based on code from add-update_item.cgi.
clean_qryparse, by Jack, is a helper for qryparse, from class, that subtitutes
HTML char codes for special characters to secure against code injection into
sed and grep and into the final HTML output.
Additional files by Jack: colornames, header, footer

- Error Handling -
these scripts consider the following to be invalid input:
* a form with any field left blank
* an add/edit form with item color not a hex triplet or valid html color name
* a delete or view page form that references a page or item that doesn't exist
* fl truncates very long strings before placing them in the format output
      this happens without any warning to the user.

— Testing —
use ewp.html's view a page form to load page names 'basetest' and 
'edgetest . ^ $ * [ < > - " \ |' to see different kinds of allowable output.

another page called 'deletetest . ^ $ * [ < > - " \ |' provides a few items
that you can use to test the delete form. If you delete them all you will see
that the delete form will report back after deleting the last item to let you
know that it has also deleted the empty page (you can check this by using
view page).

the error conditions described above have all been tested manually
